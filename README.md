Optimizing video streams in real-time using AI is a challenging task that requires a lot of processing power and optimization techniques. However, one approach to achieving this is to use a neural network that is optimized for real-time processing, such as a MobileNet or SqueezeNet model. Here's an example of how this can be done using the OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries in Python:

we first load a pre-trained MobileNet model, which is a neural network optimized for real-time processing on mobile devices. We then define a function that compresses a single frame by resizing it to the desired input shape, normalizing the pixel values, and passing it through the MobileNet model.

Next, we open the video stream using OpenCV and loop through the frames in the video stream. For each frame, we compress it using the MobileNet model and display the compressed frame using OpenCV. We also check for a key press and break out of the loop if the 'q' key was pressed.
